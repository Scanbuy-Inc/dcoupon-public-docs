# dcoupon-sdk - Third Party SDK

Document Version 1.3 (June 2021)

Latest SDK Version: 3.0.0

## Introduction

The dcoupon SDK allows to log in client' users into the dcoupon service, so users can benefit from accessing dcoupon service from 3rd party apps, without needing to use an additional login for dcoupon.

All dcoupon users must provide the following information when registering:
- External identifier (MANDATORY)
- Referral code (OPTIONAL)

and they need to accept the terms and conditions and the privacy policy of the service.

In the first access, the user will need to accept the legal documents. 

In future attempts, if any legal doc has changed, they will be prompted to accept those changes before proceeding.
